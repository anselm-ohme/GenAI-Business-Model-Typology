🚀 Where Do They Fit? — GenAI Venture Taxonomy
🧭 Introduction
Welcome to the repository accompanying the paper:

"Where Do They Fit? Categorizing Entrepreneurial Ventures in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence"
Anselm Ohme, ESCP Business School, Berlin

This repository provides the code, data, and visualizations related to the novel taxonomy framework for categorizing Generative AI (GenAI) ventures.

📄 About the Paper
The paper introduces a new two-dimensional taxonomy designed to address the unique characteristics of GenAI ventures, such as:

✅ Dependence on large foundational models
✅ High upfront compute requirements
✅ Blurred intellectual property boundaries
✅ Probabilistic, non-deterministic user experiences

The taxonomy uses two key dimensions:

General Intelligence: Evaluated via standardized model metrics (e.g., MMLU-Pro, GPQA Diamond).

Pricing Strategy: Measured as cost per million tokens.

By plotting ventures along these axes, the framework defines four strategic venture types, providing clarity for entrepreneurs, investors, and regulators.

💡 Purpose of this Repository
This repository serves to:

💻 Share code implementations of the taxonomy framework

📊 Provide example analyses and visualizations (e.g., venture mapping matrix)

🗂️ Include data and figures referenced in the study

🌱 Enable future extensions, including additional dimensions and venture datasets
